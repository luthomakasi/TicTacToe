Welcome to the Java Tic Tac Toe Game with a Graphical User Interface (GUI)! This game allows two players to engage in the classic Tic Tac Toe experience with an interactive visual interface.

How to Play
Run the Game:

Compile and run the TicTacToe.java file to start the game.

The game board is displayed as a 3x3 grid. Each cell is clickable for making moves.
Make Moves:

Players take turns clicking on an empty cell to place their symbol (X or O) on the board.
Winning:

The game will check for a winner after each move. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
Draw:

If the entire board is filled, and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
Play Again:

After the game ends, you have the option to play again.
