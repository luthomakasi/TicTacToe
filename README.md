Game Board: The game board is represented by a 3x3 grid. Each cell is identified by its row and column number.

Make Moves: Players take turns to make their moves. Enter the row and column numbers to place your symbol (X or O) on the board.

Winning: The game will check for a winner after each move. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

Draw: If the entire board is filled, and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

Play Again: After the game ends, you have the option to play again.
